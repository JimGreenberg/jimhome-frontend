Thanks for checking out this repo. This is a personal project, the goal is to create a simple way to play music over my soundbar. Why did I start this project? Because I had guests over one time and someone complained I had no music. And now, $800 and dozens of hours later I am ready to prove them wrong.

Although this repo is hosted publically and theoretically anyone could fork/clone it, this client is closely coupled with all the proxies I have set up, so this is less a contribution to the open source community and more a show-and-tell for me.
